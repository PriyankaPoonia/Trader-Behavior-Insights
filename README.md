# 📈 Trader Behavior Insights – Market Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes how market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) impacts trader performance using real trading data and the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index.



## 📊 Overview

Using two datasets:
- **Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index**  
- **Trader History from Hyperliquid**

We investigated how traders behave under different market emotions.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- During **Fear** phases:
  - Traders made more trades (120,000+)
  - But average profit per trade was lower (~₹44)

- During **Greed** phases:
  - Fewer trades occurred
  - But average profit per trade increased (~₹53)

> Traders perform **more efficiently** in Greed than Fear, suggesting better opportunities when the market is bullish.
